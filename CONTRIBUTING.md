## Meetings

*To be scheduled* — likely biweekly working sessions once the group establishes momentum.

Meeting norms:

- Agendas published 24 hours in advance
- Notes published within 48 hours

## Decision-Making

As an Interest Group, we operate by **rough consensus** — we're exploring and recommending, not deciding. Outputs include:

- Documented requirements and use cases
- Evaluated approaches with findings
- Recommendations to relevant WGs or as SEP proposals

## Contribution Guidelines

### Documenting Approaches and Findings

When adding experimental findings or new approaches:

- Include enough detail for others to reproduce or evaluate
- Note which clients and servers were tested
- Be explicit about what worked, what didn't, and what remains untested
- Attribute community input with GitHub handles and link to the source where possible

### Community Input

When adding quotes or input from community discussions:

- Attribute to the contributor by name and GitHub handle
- Link to the original source (Discord thread, GitHub comment, etc.) where possible
- Present input as blockquotes to distinguish it from editorial content

### Filing Issues

Use GitHub Issues for:

- Proposing new approaches or use cases
- Reporting gaps in documentation
- Tracking action items from meetings
